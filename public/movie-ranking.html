<h2>A short list of my favorite movies!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Lost Highway</h3>
<p>Director David Lynch takes surrealism to the next level in his first feature film since Twin Peaks, Fire Walk With Me. Combining unique
    cinematography, rockin' soundtrack, and wonderful performances by Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette! I love how even a couple decades later
    I still find myself thinking about the plot and trying to puzzle it out!

<h3>Tampopo</h3>
<p>A unique Japanese film told in a format similar to a song. The bones of the movie is a tale of a single mom trying to raise her son
    and run a ramen shop. 2 truck drivers take it upon themselves to train her to be the best ramen shop in the town! Interjecting these scenes
    are side stories illustrating all the ways food enriches our lives. Tampopo is such a feel good movie for me. You can learn an astonishing amount
    about our relationship with food too!

<h3>Paprika</h3>
<p>My favorite animated movie director, Satoshi Kon, made hit after hit. Largely inspired by the surrealism of David Lynch, Satoshi really
    made some great animated head scratchers. Paprika is a tale of a small science lab creating a device that allows you to see another person's
    dream or insert yourself into it. The movie opens with a woman called Paprika using this item as a new type of therapy. Of course shenanigans
    in the company cause things to go to heck and it's up to our team to save the world from merging with dreams. Soundtrack? Fantastic! Artwork?
    Fantastic! Story? Amazing!
